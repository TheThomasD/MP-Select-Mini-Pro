# Monoprice Select Mini Pro

This my repo to collect captures of the communication between the display and the printer board of the Monoprice Select Mini Pro.

1. Connect two USB serial converters to your Linux system
2. Connect one converter to the display, the other to the printer board
3. run `monitor.sh` (Note: might have to be run as root)
4. run `python translateIn.py` and `python translateOut.py` (Note: might have to be run as root)
